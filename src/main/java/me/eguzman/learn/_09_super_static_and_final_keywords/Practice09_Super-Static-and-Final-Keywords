1.) Write a Java program to create a class Animal with a parameterized constructor that initializes a String attribute called name. 
Create a class Dog that extends the class Animal with a parameterized constructor that takes String two parameters and 
initializes a Dogâ€™s attribute called breed and calls the Animal class constructor to initialize the name attribute.

2.) Write a Java program to create a class Calculator with a method called add() that takes two integers and returns their sum and 
another method called multiply() that takes two integers and returns their multiplication. 
Create another class that calls the methods add() and multiply() of the Calculator class without creating an instance of Calculator. 
Hint: make the methods static.

3.) Write a Java program to create a class Printer with an int attribute called id, a constructor that initializes the id attribute and 
a method called display() that prints out the class name. 
The display() method cannot be overridden, and the id cannot be modified once initialized by the constructor. 
Hint: use the final keyword accordingly.
